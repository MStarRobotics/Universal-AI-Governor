//! Hardware integration for Universal AI Governor
//!
//! This module provides the crucial interface for integrating the Universal AI Governor
//! with hardware security modules (HSMs) and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs).
//! This integration is fundamental to achieving a "PhD level" of security and trust
//! in AI systems. By leveraging hardware-backed roots of trust, it ensures the integrity
//! of AI operations, protects sensitive data, and provides an immutable foundation for
//! auditability. This directly contributes to the "humanization effect" by building
//! verifiable trust and enables "AI bypass" of software-only vulnerabilities, making
//! the AI governance framework significantly more robust against sophisticated attacks.

/// cryptographic operations, and platform integrity measurements. Its integration
/// is vital for establishing a strong root of trust for the AI Governor.
