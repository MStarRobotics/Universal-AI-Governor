## Reporting Security Issues

### Please don't open public issues for security problems

I really appreciate when people find security issues, but please report them privately first. Here's why this matters and how to do it right:

**The right way:**
- Email me directly at: morningstar.xcd@gmail.com
- Use the subject line: "[SECURITY] Brief description"
- Give me a reasonable amount of time to fix it before going public
- Work with me to verify the fix

**Please don't:**
- Open a public GitHub issue for security problems
- Post about it on social media before I can fix it
- Try to access data that doesn't belong to you
- Run automated scanners against production systems

### What to include in your report

When you email me about a security issue, please include:

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Brief description of the issue

1. What's the problem?
   - Clear description of the vulnerability
   - Which part of the system is affected
   - How serious you think it is

2. How did you find it?
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Any proof-of-concept code (if safe to share)
   - Screenshots or logs if helpful

3. What's the impact?
   - What could an attacker do with this?
   - What data or systems could be compromised?
   - Any ideas for how to fix it?

4. Your info (optional)
   - Name if you want credit
   - How to contact you for follow-up
```

### What happens next

**Within 24 hours:** I'll acknowledge that I got your report and give you an initial assessment.

**Within a week:** I'll either have a fix ready or give you a realistic timeline for when I'll have one.

**After the fix:** We'll coordinate on when and how to disclose the issue publicly (if appropriate).

I try to be pretty responsive, but please be patient if it takes me a day or two to get back to you - I might be traveling or dealing with other urgent issues.

## Security Architecture

### How I think about security

This project handles sensitive AI governance decisions, so I've tried to build security in from the ground up rather than bolting it on later. Here's the basic approach:

```
    User Request
         |
    [Input Validation] <- First line of defense
         |
    [Authentication] <- Who are you?
         |
    [Authorization] <- What can you do?
         |
    [Policy Engine] <- Business logic security
         |
    [Hardware Security] <- TPM/HSM backing
         |
    [Audit Logging] <- Track everything
```

### Hardware-backed security

One of the things I'm most proud of in this project is the hardware security integration. Most "enterprise" software just does software-only crypto, which is like having a really good lock on a paper door.

**TPM 2.0 Integration:**
- Keys are generated and stored in hardware
- Attestation proves the system hasn't been tampered with
- PCR binding ensures keys only work on trusted systems

**HSM Support:**
- PKCS#11 integration for enterprise hardware security modules
- High-performance crypto operations
- Tamper-evident key storage

**Secure Enclave:**
- Apple Secure Enclave support on macOS
- Intel SGX for Linux systems (where available)
- ARM TrustZone integration

### Cryptographic choices

I've tried to make conservative, well-tested choices for crypto:

**Symmetric encryption:** AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305
**Asymmetric crypto:** RSA-4096, ECDSA P-384, Ed25519
**Hashing:** SHA-3, BLAKE3
**Key derivation:** PBKDF2, Argon2, HKDF

I'm also working on post-quantum crypto support, but that's still experimental.

---

## Common Security Questions

### "Is this actually secure?"

I've tried to build this with security as a first-class concern, not an afterthought. That said, security is hard and I'm sure there are issues I haven't thought of. That's why I really appreciate security researchers who take the time to look at this stuff.

### "What about supply chain attacks?"

Good question. I use `cargo-audit` and `cargo-deny` to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies. I also try to minimize the dependency tree and stick to well-maintained crates.

### "Do you have any certifications?"

Not yet, but I'm working on SOC2 compliance and have built in support for GDPR and HIPAA requirements. If you need specific certifications for your use case, let me know and I can prioritize that work.

### "What about quantum computers?"

I'm working on post-quantum cryptography support, but it's not ready for production yet. The current crypto should be fine for the next several years, but I'm keeping an eye on NIST's post-quantum standards.

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Deployment security

**Use TLS everywhere:**
```toml
[server.tls]
enabled = true
cert_file = "/path/to/your/cert.pem"
key_file = "/path/to/your/key.pem"
min_version = "1.3"  # Don't use older TLS versions
```

**Enable hardware security if you have it:**
```toml
[security]
tpm_required = true  # If you have TPM 2.0
hardware_backed_auth = true
```

**Set up proper monitoring:**
```toml
[audit]
enabled = true
level = "comprehensive"  # Log everything important
retention_days = 365     # Keep logs for compliance
```

### Operational security

**Keep it updated:** I try to release security updates quickly, so please keep your installation current.

**Monitor the logs:** The audit logs will show you if something weird is happening.

**Use strong authentication:** Enable multi-factor auth if your environment supports it.

**Network security:** Run this behind a firewall and use network segmentation.

---

## Security Testing

### What I test

I run several types of security tests on every release:

**Static analysis:** `cargo clippy` with security-focused lints
**Dependency scanning:** `cargo audit` for known vulnerabilities
**Fuzzing:** I fuzz the policy parser and crypto operations
**Integration testing:** End-to-end security scenarios

### What you can test

If you want to do your own security testing:

**Allowed:**
- Testing against your own installations
- Automated scanning of public interfaces (within reason)
- Code review and static analysis
- Responsible disclosure of issues you find

**Please don't:**
- Attack other people's installations
- Try to access data that doesn't belong to you
- Run intensive scans that could impact service availability
- Social engineer me or other contributors

---

## Incident Response

### If something bad happens

**Step 1:** Don't panic. Document what you're seeing and contact me immediately.

**Step 2:** If it's an active attack, isolate the affected systems if you can do so safely.

**Step 3:** Preserve logs and evidence, but don't spend too much time on forensics if the attack is ongoing.

**Step 4:** We'll work together to understand what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.

### What I'll do

- Acknowledge the incident within a few hours
- Work with you to understand the scope and impact
- Develop and test a fix
- Coordinate on disclosure and communication
- Do a post-incident review to improve our security

## Contact Information

**For security issues:** morningstar.xcd@gmail.com

**For general questions:** Open a GitHub issue or discussion

**Response time:** I try to respond to security issues within 24 hours, other questions within a few days.

### For Developers

#### Secure Coding Practices

**Input Validation:**
```rust
use validator::Validate;

#[derive(Validate)]
struct PolicyRequest {
    #[validate(length(min = 1, max = 10000))]
    policy_content: String,
    
    #[validate(regex = "^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$")]
    policy_name: String,
}

pub fn create_policy(request: PolicyRequest) -> Result<Policy, ValidationError> {
    request.validate()?;
    // Process validated input
}
```

**Error Handling:**
```rust
// Don't leak sensitive information in errors
pub enum PublicError {
    InvalidInput,
    Unauthorized,
    InternalError,
}

impl From<InternalError> for PublicError {
    fn from(err: InternalError) -> Self {
        // Log detailed error internally
        log::error!("Internal error: {:?}", err);
        // Return generic error to user
        PublicError::InternalError
    }
}
```

**Cryptographic Operations:**
```rust
use ring::aead;
use zeroize::Zeroize;

#[derive(Zeroize)]
struct SecretData {
    data: Vec<u8>,
}

impl Drop for SecretData {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        self.zeroize();
    }
}

// Use constant-time operations for sensitive comparisons
use subtle::ConstantTimeEq;

fn verify_token(provided: &[u8], expected: &[u8]) -> bool {
    provided.ct_eq(expected).into()
}
```

        let result = process_user_input(malicious_input);
        assert!(result.is_err());
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_timing_attack_resistance() {
        let start = std::time::Instant::now();
        let _ = verify_password("correct_password", "stored_hash");
        let correct_time = start.elapsed();

        let start = std::time::Instant::now();
        let _ = verify_password("wrong_password", "stored_hash");
        let wrong_time = start.elapsed();

        // Timing should be similar (within reasonable variance)
        let time_diff = (correct_time.as_nanos() as i64 - wrong_time.as_nanos() as i64).abs();
        assert!(time_diff < 1_000_000); // 1ms variance
    }
}
```
